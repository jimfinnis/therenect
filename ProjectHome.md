The Therenect is a virtual Theremin for the Kinect controller. It defines two virtual antenna points, which allow controlling the pitch and volume of a simple oscillator. The distance to these points can be adjusted by freely moving the hand in three dimensions or by reshaping the hand, which allows gestures that should be quite similar to playing an actual Theremin.

This application has been created by <a href='http://modin.yuri.at'>Martin Kaltenbrunner</a> at the <a href='http://www.interface.ufg.ac.at'>Interface Culture Lab</a>. It is based on <a href='http://www.openframeworks.cc'>OpenFrameworks</a> and its <a href='http://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinect'>ofxKinect</a> example, which is integrating <a href='https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect'>libfreenect</a> by the <a href='http://openkinect.org/'>OpenKinect</a> project. Many thanks to all the developers involved in the process, without their work this application wouldn't have been that easy to implement.<p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>
In order to compile this application you will need a working installation of OpenFrameworks and the ofxKinect and ofxControlPanel extension. The provided application has been compiled as a Universal binary for Mac OS 10.5 or later.<br>
